FTP protocol

FTP or better known as file transfer protocol is very popular for hosting files on a server. We will be coding this project on python because of lack of implementation for this protocol in C++. The module that we will be using for this library is pyftpdlib which is a python abstraction around the FTP server.

Being in python this is very simple to implement and contains of very small part of codes being written. The following steps are as the program will react to

1> Add all users along with permissions to where there accesible to .

2> Add directory for anonymous logins.

3> Start the FTP server.
