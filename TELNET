TELNET

Telnet was used to access terminal on remote machine before SSH. It has been used historically by system administrator to monitor the system.In this project we will be making a small telnet server based on RUBY language from scratch. This is because we were not able to find any good library implementation of telnet server on the internet being old.

So our telnet server would simply use socket to accept all the connection and then interact with the client in order to provide them with system shell . The system shell can enable them to modify call and terminate any process running on the raspbery pi at that instance.

Basic modules of Telnet are as follows:

1> Socket server which is responsible for listening to all the connection requests to the server and sending back the response.

2> Processing engine which is responsible for interpreting and running the commands that are sent by the end user.
